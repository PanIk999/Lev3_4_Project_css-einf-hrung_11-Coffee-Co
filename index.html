OUR STORY
I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home.
After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.
CATERING SERVICES
A voyage in the tastes and perfumes of the Silk Road… Persia on a platter.
Reinventing Persian family recipes with subtle and varied flavours for an exotic Persian taste.
Whatever your special occasion, from family dinners to corporate events and galleries to weddings, we can cater to make a memorable experience for everyone involved.

OUR CAKES
NO ADDITIVES NO PRESERVATIVES and NO COLOURING is the motto we live by. We also always try to have a gluten free and vegan option on display for those guests with special dietary requirements.
