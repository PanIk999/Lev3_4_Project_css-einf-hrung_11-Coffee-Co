                                    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                                    <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding
                                        to give up my 9
                                        to 5 job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to
                                        operate a business
                                        was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the
                                        customers were guests
                                        in my home.
                                        After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the
                                        art of the
                                        business but have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh
                                        ingredients and cook
                                        the food I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and
                                        served
                                        immediately to our guests.</p>
